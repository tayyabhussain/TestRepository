Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows superfamily of operating systems, as well as web sites, web applications and web services. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.

## Pros

### **Intellisense**

During Programming the feature of intellisense diplays the suggestions to the programmer in a drop down manner. Such as showing suggestion box that will notify the user what methods and functions are available. When clicking on one of the methods in the suggestion box the environment will tell the programmer exactly what the method will do and how many and what parameters are needed.

### **Automatic code formatting**

This is also know as auto indentation. While typing code your code automatically indents when you type brackets.

### **Extensibility**

Code a new tool for it or use one of the many available to the developers using Visual Studio Gallery. This site is a wealth of fixes for things that developers didn’t like with Visual Studio and decided to fix.

## Cons

### **CPU Hog**

When running Visual Studio it is a must that you have plenty of RAM to spare.

### **Overwhelming GUI**

When first starting it up, the layout of buttons and panes can be a little/very confusing at first. This will take time to adjust, so the downfall is there is a steep learning curve with the layout.

### **Cost**

With the 2008 Professional edition of Visual Studio costing a thousand dollars (without MSDN subscription).

# 2) **[Eclipse][2]**
 

![alt text](http://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/eclipse_logo_3-0.gif?w=580&h=383 "Eclipse")


Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog,Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. 


## Pros

### **Language Extensibility**

The languages mentioned above are not limited by Microsoft and anyone is free to develop plug-ins for different languages and to make the development environment easier to use. 

### **Free**

Besides being fully customizable and extensible, the next best thing about eclipse is it’s free.

## Cons

### **Steep Learning Curve**

With so much available to upgrade and add on, the learning curve of eclipse is quite steep. 


# 3) **[Netbeans][3]**

![alt text](http://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/launch_netbeans.png?w=580&h=367 "Netbeans")


NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, but also with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5. It is also an application platform framework for Java desktop applications and others.


## Pros

### **Extensible**

Extensibility is a must have for the development environments out there to survive. Instead of having multiple programs for multiple different languages combining them into one program gains recognition from developers and the software programs that combine it all.

### **Free**

Netbeans is an Open source IDE.

## Cons

### **CPU Hog**

When running Visual Studio it is a must that you have plenty of RAM to spare.


### **Bloated**

While using this program computer slows down, throws errors in program that one didn’t know existed etc. This is a tough software program to master and when coding one have to be careful. 

# 4) **[Kate][4]**


![alt text](http://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/screenshot-kate.png?w=580&h=380 "kate")


Kate (short for KDE Advanced Text Editor) is a text editor made by KDE. It has been a part of K Desktop Environment 2 since 2001. Geared towards software developers, it features syntax highlighting, code folding, customizable layouts that can be recalled via presets, regular expression support and extensibility.

## Pros

### **Uses Linux**


### **Code Folding**

This is probably one of the best features for kate. There is a small column to the left of the code. Any line that is an opening bracket that column will have an arrow next to it. If you click the arrow it will fold all of the code between the opening and closing brackets. Very useful for large source packages.

## Cons

### **KDE Overhead**

250 Mb of overhead just to use the application. This is not just one package but several packages that are required to be on the system just to start the application. This may not be the best choice if you are using a net-book for development purposes on the go but if you have a Linux box at home this would do just fine.

# 5) **[Code::Blocks][5]**


![alt text](http://b2b.cbsimg.net/gallery/6415795-620-452.jpg "Code Blocks")

Code::Blocks is a free C, C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable.
Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with plugins. Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin. For instance, compiling and debugging functionality is already provided by plugins!

##Pros

- Need to download one file, setup time 20 seconds
- Open Source IDE 

##Cons

- Not configurable
- Only for C, C++, Fortran

# 6) **[gedit][6]**


![alt text](http://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gedit-logo.png?w=580 "gedit")


gedit is the default text editor of the GNOME desktop environment and part of the GNOME Core Applications. Bascially it is not an IDE but installing coupe og plugins makes it. Designed as a general purpose text editor, gedit emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It includes tools for editing source code and structured text such as markup languages.
It is designed to have a clean, simple graphical user interface according to the philosophy of the GNOME project, and it is the default text editor for GNOME.In addition, it is also available for both Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

##Pros

### **Uses Linux**

### **Already Installed on gnome systems**

This is a major bonus for Linux users. If the application is already installed on the system.

### **Code Highlighting**

gedit offers the ability to highlight your code and figure out where the bugs are by giving you a fresh perspective. This can also be used for web development, to help developers see where the start of nodes are and where to submit the end nodes.

### **Tabbed**

This feature allows multiple source packages open at once to jump back and forth between if needed. This is a highly useful when comparing documents and debugging code.

##Cons

- **Doesn’t Compile Code**

#7) **[VIM][7]**

![alt text](http://blog.dispatched.ch/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/vim-as-python-ide.png?5d7231 "VIM")

Vim ( a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a text editor written by Bram Moolenaar and first released publicly in 1991. Based on the vi editor common to Unix-like systems, Vim is designed for use both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is free and open source software. The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License.Although Vim was originally released for the Amiga, Vim has since been developed to be cross-platform, supporting many other platforms. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers.Basically VIM is a text editor but it can be used as an IDE by installing 

##Pros

### **Available everywhere**

VIM is available for every operating system whether it is Linux, windows or Mac.

### **Productivity**

VIM  can do pretty much everything without leaving the home row, and that makes you more efficient when you need it most.

### **Customizability**

VIM is programmable, and there is an extensive body of available packages. However, Vim is an editor with a macro language.

### **As an IDE**

Vim has support for a lot of programming languages and other text formats. Beyond the basics such as syntactic coloring and automatic indentation, it also has advanced IDE features such as code and documentation cross-reference lookups, assisted insertions and refactoring, integrated version control, and the ability to initiate a compilation and jump to the first error.

##Cons

### **Initial learning curve**

Vim's learning curve starts steep, steeper than any other editor, although this can be lessened by using gvim.

### **Asymptotic learning curve**

Vim has a lot of features, and one will keep discovering new ones after years of use.

#**IDE of my Choice**

I choose **VIM** over all of the other top IDEs used in the world because of the following reasons:

- Vim can do all the major things example tabs, file trees, greping, syntax highlighting, indentation, completion, quickfix, etc.
- Vim is guaranteed to exist on all Unix systems and exists on most Linux ones as well. That kind of broad coverage makes learning and using    it worth it.
- Vim is at once ubiquitous and incredibly powerful, and by learning it once, one can gain the ability to exercise that power on pretty much    any computer that has a keyboard.
- Handles large files easily.
- Syntax colouring. This is really nice when reading XML or program source.
- One can edit anything he/she want over e.g. SSH connections, with minimal bandwidth/latency requirements.
- The entire editor can be customize that it fits to developer's preferences.
- Faster editing beacuse one do not need to take hand of the keyboard.
- Supports split windows
- Adcanced searching
- Vim Is free and has a vibrant community
- Vim works over telnet and SSH connections
- Vim configuration is portable
- Vim compiles/has precompiled binaries for almost every OS available.
- There are a lot of good plugins available to add alot of functionality, such as in-editor,cvs,diffs.
